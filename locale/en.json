    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "What is Easy SaaS Next?",
        "answer": "Easy SaaS Next is a SaaS application framework based on Nextjs that helps developers quickly build SaaS applications."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I get a refund after purchase?",
        "answer": "Since Easy SaaS Next is a virtual product, refunds are not supported. Please purchase carefully."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will there be technical support after purchase?",
        "answer": "Easy SaaS Next provides technical support. You can contact us via email or join the paid group for technical support. However, due to limited resources, we cannot provide free one-on-one technical support. Thank you for your understanding."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Easy SaaS Next suitable for me?",
        "answer": "If you don't have programming basics, we recommend learning some prerequisite knowledge (which can be found in the documentation) or contacting us directly for customization. If you have sufficient programming foundation, Easy SaaS Next can help you quickly build your SaaS application."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the video tutorials free?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! The video tutorials are free. You can learn how to use Easy SaaS Next through the video tutorials and practice based on the content in the tutorials to build your SaaS application. If you find the video tutorials helpful or want to use Easy SaaS Next's source code directly to build your SaaS application, you can purchase the paid version."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between the video tutorials and the paid version?",
        "answer": "The video tutorials are free, and some key code explanations and practices are included, but the complete source code is not included, so you cannot get the complete source code from the tutorials. The paid version includes the complete source code, and you can get the complete source code and technical support."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will the template be updated continuously?",
        "answer": "Yes, I will continue to update the template and provide technical support."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use AI to modify this template?",
        "answer": "Yes, because the technologies used in Easy SaaS Next are open source and AI-friendly, you can fully use AI to modify this template."
