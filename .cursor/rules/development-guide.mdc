# Development Guide

## Code Organization

- Components should be placed in `src/components`
- Pages should be placed in `src/app`
- Database models should be placed in `src/db`
- Business logic should be placed in `src/service`
- Utility functions should be placed in `src/lib`

## Best Practices

1. Use TypeScript for all new code
2. Follow the component structure:
   - One component per file
   - Place related components in a shared directory
   - Use index.ts for exports
3. Use hooks for shared stateful logic
4. Keep components small and focused
5. Use proper TypeScript types from `src/types`

## Database

- Use Drizzle ORM for database operations
- Place database schemas in `src/db/schema`
- Place migrations in `src/db/migrations`

## Internationalization

- Use i18n system for all user-facing strings
- Place translations in `src/i18n` directory
- Follow the locale file structure for new translations

## icon

- Prefer icons from lucide-react
